This project focuses on the development of an interactive application that integrates machine learning with computer graphics. We utilized Google's QuickDraw dataset, with a specific focus on the "fish" category, to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The core function of this model is to recognize doodles provided by the user through a sketch input interface.

The application provides a simple drawing canvas for users to create on. Once a drawing is completed, the system sends the sketch to the backend CNN model for real-time analysis. If the model classifies the drawing as a "fish," it triggers a dynamic fish tank animation. This animation seamlessly adds the user's newly drawn fish into the virtual aquarium, where it swims alongside others.

This project not only demonstrates the potential of deep learning for real-time image recognition but also delivers a complete creative and interactive experience. By transforming user creations into dynamic visual feedback through the fish tank animation, it successfully bridges user creativity with an engaging application.
